# Image Classification with Keras
This is a concrete crack detection project. The goal is to correctly identify images of cracked concretes from 40,000 RGB images. I utilize 2 pre-trained models - ResNet50 and VGG16 to complete this task. Both of them do well in this job with accuracy higher than 90%.
